# Considerations

To choose the right database system, it is necessary to consider different aspects:

- Integrability: can I integrate it with my frontend and other services?
- Scalability: how well does it scale?
- Support: is customer support available?
- Budget: how much would it cost to rent a server for it?
- CAP theorem: which ones do we need?
- **Simplicity**: how easy is the system to maintain?

# Applications

For financial applications, where availability plays an import role, relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, might be a better choice than NoSQL databases. For other use cases, such as big data applications, even logging software, and such, NoSQL databases may offer more advantages, like better write/read performance, schema flexibility, and ease of scalability.
