## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

What is a complex system?

> “a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit
one or more properties \[...] not obvious from the properties of the
individual parts” 

- [Complex System on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system)


The behaviour that arises as a result of the interaction of all components of the system is called **emergent behaviour**. It cannot be predicted from studying the components individually.
> "The whole is more of the sum of its parts"

Examples of emergent behaviour:
- Stock market crashes
- Traffic jams
- Weather

## Modelling Methods <a name="modelling-methods"></a>

Two techniques that can be used to model complex systems are:
- Agent-based Modelling, using NetLogo
- Process algebra and stochastic simulation, using Bio-PEPA

### NetLogo <a name="netlogo"></a>


### Bio-PEPA <a name="bio-pepa"></a>


## Agent-based Modelling <a name="agent-based-modelling"></a>

A complex system can be represented as a collection of agents (a collection of *autonomous decision-making entitites*) by using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). Agents represent individual entities that act on the basis of a certain set of rules. Their behaviour depends on the system being modelled, e.g. movement, interaction/communication, birth, death, reproduction, etc.
